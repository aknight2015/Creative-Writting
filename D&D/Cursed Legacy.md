## Adventurers College

### Description

The college is basically the various guilds (Fighter, bard, wizard, etc.) using a single common area to present a unified location for education. (Wow. I need to reword that monstrocity.)

It was created using a demiplane. Originally it had a few modest buildings, one for each profession. As they grew they created a link to Sigil, and then the Infinite Staircase. This allowed the college to grow at an exponential rate.

- The door to the Infinite Staircase allowed evil to creep in.
  
- Big fight
  
- Cut off access to the Infinite Staircase
  
- Rumor is that the door is still there, just hidden.
  

### Courses

**Ethics of dungeoneering**: a deep dive on how to clear out infested caves and castles while leaving the natural ecosystem intact and ensuring that the former residents can live in the area safely again

**Counterspelling 201**: everyone knows about counterspell, but what about when someone counterspells your counterspell? This class goes over how counter a countered counterspell.

**Martial defense against magic**: a sword is good for many things, but it can't block a fireball. This is an essential class for all martial adventurers to know how to safely close the distance and silence any enemy mages before, during, or after combat has started.

**Field surgery, magical anatomy, and bushmeat culinary arts**: a combination class that teaches basic medical knowledge that will save the lives of wounded allies, the anatomy of all races of people the party is likely to come across, and the anatomy of any monsters they may face (as well as what parts are edible, what parts taste the best, and what parts sell for the most on the open market) they were once three separate classes, but after realizing that all three classes had a deluge of questions relating to each other, it was decided to merge the three. There was also the "demon-steak incedent" but no one talks about that.

**Laconic speech**: a class designed to teach you how to say the most with the fewest words. Perfect for the brooding warrior poet in all of us. Also very popular with less than charismatic people due to the short assignments

**Party cohesion 101**: teaches the fundamentals about working with a group. This class is taken by entire grouos and focuses on teaching team building, trust building, and basic party tactics. It also focuses on the dangers of going off alone.

**Practical use of magics**: teaches how basic spells can be used to make the adventurers lives easier and better and how to use cantrips and low level spells to counter some common obstacles. (How to use move earth to create quick trenches, how to use prestidigitation to make food taste better, or lure away guards, etc.)

**Creative use of practical items**: a class that goes over all of the uses of mundane items and how they can be used in dangerous situations. Of particular interest is the obstacle course. It starts with ball bearings on stairs, caltrops hidden at the bottom, a flask of oil that lights when a match is dropped on it, and a block and tackle holding back a tree trunk

**Pets, familiars, and mounts**: a class that helps young adventurers find a pet that suits their adventuring needs. Also teaches basic tactics and care for your new friend. (Your magical familiar does not need food or drink. If you do feed them they may get magical diarrhea; treat them well, they will leave; if you have a magical summon they can be brought back with a ritual spell; your mount can move for you while you attack; etc.)

**The monsters know what they're doing**: a class that comprehensively explains common monster tactics and some counters to them.

**Commando tactics for small scale warfare**: a class that teaches tactics for adventurering parties and how to "play your role" in a group most effectively

**Cursebiting 101**: teaches how to recognize cursed items and how to fight the urge to use them, or alternatively how to fight a curse when it is placed on you or a party member.

**Mixology**: a class for funky youths that want to learn the way of the turntables so that they can spit hot bars at their foes in the field or keep their party relaxed with a funky groove. Mostly taken by bards, rangers, and druids (the latter two getting the class mixed up with herbology, which teaches how to recognize fauna and create potions)

**Beyond alignment**: teaches students that situations in the adventuring world often go beyond good, evil, choas, and law, and challenges students to handle ethically challenging situations while also fulfilling their mission.

**Riddleometry/puzzalgebra**: teaches students how to think outside the box and how to solve ancient riddles made to keep interlopers out.

### Mad ravings of the DM

### Monsters with possibilities

- Berbalang

#### Temporal Mass and its effects on legendary beings

If time is the result of matter, the same way electricity is the result of magnets interacting with copper. Could things made of matter have temporal mass? Things with greater temporal mass having a greater influence on how time interacts and behaves with other matter. This is why some beings seem to have a larger influence on how future events play out, and why if you try to remove their influence from the flow of time you encounter more and more resistance. An example would be Darksied from DC Comics. Darksied is considered one of the pillars of creation. Meaning Darksied can't be destroyed. If the same logic applies to all fictional canon then Vecna could be considered the D&D equivalent of a Pillar of Creation. Meaning that Vecna must always exist for time to flow properly. Just like Acerack. That would also explain why deities cannot actually die. Their power may ebb and flow, but certain ones cannot be destroyed.

---

### Horcruxes in Non-Harry Potter fiction

Examples of such things are the demon artifacts from Doom 3. So long as those artifacts exist in our realm they can be activated and allow a demonic invasion.

How can this be used in a TTRPG setting?

---

### Synopsis

---

The Death Knight known as "Kas The Bloody Handed" seeks to ~~resurrect his long dead~~ offer souls to his master seeking to atone for sins he believes he committed. The various wikis don't offer much in the way of the status of Vecna. He could still be a god, or a demigod, or back on Oerth, or in a Domain of Dread, or just anywhere. So the "end of the road" is still up in the air. The point of this is to give power to his master. The result is WHO THE '************************************' KNOWS?!?!?!?! I figured it out. I added an extraplanar aspect to the game. They want to unify Vecnas control over the multiverse by forming bridges between all versions that exist of him at all points in time and across various realities. Alternative to above, Domain of Dread. Creating a Dark Multiverse. The Domain is linked to a Dark Multiverse where the spectre of Venca resides. He wants to create a dark version of Sigil and use that to bind the two. Even if he fails, his Dark Multiverse will cast a constant shadow on the Multiverse itself.

OR, hear me out, we try something not as insane. That particular plotline is WAY to big. That would need a great deal more than a few cursed artifacts.

What would it need?

1. Research on Nexus points in the D&D multiverse
  
  1. Places where the various universes and planes intersect and allow travel
2. What kinds of artifacts allow magical travel
  
3. Power source
  
4. Spells
  
5. Common threads connecting all multiverses together.
  
6. How to manipulate those threads.
  
  1. Imbuing an essence into those threads.

Still need to figure out why Kas is doing this. So, the fake Kas is haunted by his betrayal.

### The How and Why

Using his old masters networks Kas commissioned several cursed artifacts that function as both an artifact of great power, and also as soul bags.

To accomplish this Kas first looked into the failed endeavors of Acerack the Archlich and his Soulmonger device. Using some of the recovered shards of the device Kas had them used in the construction of the artifacts. He also had the artifacts created in a manner similar to a Hags soul bag.

The purpose of the bag is to collect the harvested souls. The artifacts all require a sacrifice. The artifact collected both those killed using the artifact, but also the one who wields the artifact when their fate inevitably catches up with them.

Note: I need to flesh out the "end of the road" part. (What does this mean? ----> It means the "why" of things.)

So, by sheer luck I got an ad for a AI RPG generator for DMs. So I was able to input my conundrum and it gave me a workable answer. Kas is doing this to amass enough power to finish his masters work.

Okay. So I figured THIS part out. Kas has the help of a hag. The owner of the Moon-Touched blade chased her out of her territory because of the call of the abandoned church that was in her swamp. More on the church in a moment. Because she was chased out Kas approached her and she agreed to help him in exchange for her territory back. She doesn't know that Kas arranged for her to be chased out.

Now, the church. Kas placed the blade in the church knowing the druid would be lured to it due to the fact that the hag was corrupting the environment. Durring the confrontation the eldritch horror that once inhabited the church begins speaking to the druid.

The nothic remains a conundrum.

Phylactery

> A lich is created by an arcane ritual that traps the wizard's soul within a phylactery. Doing so binds the soul to the mortal world [...] A phylactery is traditionally an amulet in the shape of a small box, but **<u>it can take the form of any item possessing an interior space</u>** into which arcane sigils of naming, binding, immortality, and dark magic are scribed in silver.

> With its phylactery prepared, the future lich drinks a potion of transformation-a vile concoction of poison mixed with the blood of a sentient creature whose soul is sacrificed to the phylactery. The wizard falls dead, then rises as a lich as its soul is drawn into the phylactery, where it forever remains.

> A lich must periodically feed souls to its phylactery to sustain the magic preserving its body and consciousness. [It traps souls within the Phylactery, which must be on the same plane of existence, by using a powerful spell]. A creature imprisoned in the phylactery for 24 hours is consumed and destroyed utterly [...] A lich that fails or forgets to maintain its body with sacrificed souls begins to physically fall apart, and might eventually become a demilich.

> When a lich's body is broken by accident or assault, the will and mind of the lich drains from it, leaving only a lifeless corpse behind. Within days, a new body reforms next to the lich's phylactery, coalescing out of glowing smoke that issues from the device. Because the destruction of its phylactery means the possibility of eternal death, a lich usually keeps its phylactery in a hidden, well-guarded location.

Can a phylactery be a artificially constructed demiplane? In DC lore there's something called the Source Wall:

> The **Source Wall** is a solid barrier surrounding the [Multiverse](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Multiverse "Multiverse"), beyond which lies [the Source](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/The_Source "The Source").

### The Artifacts

Pushes them to more and more extreme designs using more and more extreme components. Eventually involves living sacrifices and using organic parts for the designs.

#### Scribes Pen

Consisting of a quill and inkwell the artifact acts as a muse and scribe. Most of his works center on dark and eldritch horror. Murders and destruction.

## The Actual Story

### Starting point note

The players starting conditions have yet to be finalized. So far we have tavern on the Infinite Staircase as part of a caravan guard. Tavern in a town. Caravan guards in a caravan. Not a clue yet. Hell, at this point I'm willing to give "recently graduated from adventurers college" a shot.

College finals. Take care of the Ankheg problem. Professors use divination spells to determine what each groups final task is.

---

### Dust of Dryness

So, at some point one of the players falls ill due to ingesting the Dust of Dryness cursed artifact. Due to the fact that they are all level 1, and are just nomads rather than real adventurers, is what made the party a target. This leads them to the hospital, which leads them to finding out this is not uncommon. A number of people, usually homeless or forgotten, have turned up with this illness. It's manifesting as an illness rather than a poison. This is due to the necromantic nature of the affliction.

##### Behind the scenes

The tavern is run by a retired adventure. He seeks a solution to his rat problem. A bag of poison magically appears in his storeroom. The poison is the cursed dust of dryness. By using it to kill the rats it feels their life to him, revitalizing him. He eventually notices the bag doesn't ever seem to run out so he starts conducting experiments. He monitors its use, and during these experiments he realizes that every time one of the rats dies, he feels a tiny bit stronger. He begins using it on larger creatures in the sewers, eventually clearing out large areas. As his grows stronger he begins to seeks greater and greater power over death, leading him to the necromantic arts.

He creates skeletal rats under his command that act as spies. Using those spies he finds out where he can find more items of necromatic power. Using the newly cleared areas of the sewers he stores these items and creates a makeshift base. Most of the items were small trinkets and minor magic items.

###### Notes

Various tiny trinkets and books. Mentions various liches and necromancers. One mentions The Serpent.

### Dread Helm

The cursed helm finds its way into the possession of a foot soldier. Under the influence of the helm the foot soldier finds himself able to demonstrate feats of tactical ingenuity he was incapable of before hand. As his tactical genius grew, so does his charisma, and arrogance.

He is given control of a [Insert player level appropriate size for challenge here]. At some point the players come to this fort [I'm thinking caravan escort to keep the overall plot somewhat obfuscated.]. They are placed under arrest under false charges. Taken to the dungeons where they see first hand the "efficiency" of the commanders leadership. All but a few of the soldiers here are fiercely loyal to the commander. The only soldiers that aren't loyal are new arrivals. The longer the soldiers stay, the more fanatical they become. [Daily wisdom saves. Use exhaustion levels to denote fanaticism level.] Not even the player are immune.

### Cloak of Many Fashions

---

Note: The players will be involved because it's their body parts they want to use to create the next "fashion."

---

Mysterious merchant sells the cloak to a minor noble. The cloak makes them a center of attention fashion wise. Slowly inspires more and more outlandish designs. Accumulates a small grouping of followers. Eventually becomes a cult. Starts incorporating necromantic designs into the various fashions. They start to use more and more exotic designs. Eventually they start using people. Starting with strays and vagabonds. Then arranging accidents for rivals. Eventually the players attract their eye.

### Scribes Pen

Desperate bard spends last gold on a "lucky" quill and inkwell set. At first it's just small things. Small whispers of creativity. As he writes he slowly notices some of the things he writes become real. The more detail he puts in, the more real it is. He ends up creating the book of Eibon. He creates an artifact of evil that exists outside of time and space. Inside are rituals that give birth to some of the most powerful eldritch evils in any multiverse. Basically, it's a temporal self creation loops, it created itself. Among the eldritch evils in there is mention of The Serpent, and other beings so old their origins are long forgotten. Goes back to the Temporal Mass theory I typed up earlier in the document. It's a pillar of creation so it must always exist. It curses the bard with nightmares of strange otherworldly horrors.

**Note**: After the players defeat the bard if they search his things they'll discover a half written story about their exploits so far. The half written book starts when the campaign started. There are also notes, and half explinations. They are the backstories of the players characters. Representing the incomplete nature of a backstory, IE lack of full biography.

### Moon-Touched Sword

Lawful evil druid gains possession of the cursed blade. Found in the ruins of an old church deep in a forest. Druid has an extraplanar patron. Abandoned church has a hidden doorway to Domain of Dread. It's corrupting influence has warped the Druid.

Creating a small village near the church with the help of the were creatures the Druid created using the sword. Slowly the malefic force influences the other were creatures, eventually changing their alignment.

### Charlatan's Dice

Compels the wielder to engage in games of chance whenever one is offered. Always has a gold piece available strictly for gambling. If the owner tries to rid himself of the dice they die in a agonizingly unlucky way. The dice do not have to be used, only carried.

Series of murders, and accidents.

Any player that engages an individual that possesses the Charlatan's Dice will suffer a curse if they loose to the possessor. I'm debating whether to give enemies advantage against them or a flat bonus to hit.

## Additional Adventures

---

### Ankheg Trouble (Level 1-3)

A local farmer needs help dealing with a infestation of Ankhegs. They keep burrowing under his farm, ruining the crops and eating the live stock.

Durring the adventure the players will stumble upon ancient tunnels that the ankhegs had burrowed into. The tunnels lead into a small dungeon.

Dungeon is filled with aberrations.

Core spawn crawlers possible enemies.

Star Spawn Grue also possible. Adds a bit of lovecraft to it.

#### BBGEG Ideas

- Could be a Nothic. They are labeled as Dark Oracles.
  
- BBEG of the dungeon is basically a brain in a jar. So just use any CR appropriate monster and give it a glass top of the skull.
  

Player discover the dead body of a Berbalang.

#### Monsters (Focusing on constructs and aberrations)

1. Nothic
  
2. Core Spawn Crawlers
  
3. Bagiennik
  
4. Choker
  
5. Cranium Rats
  
6. Gibbering Mouther
  
7. Animated Armor (Remember brain in a jar. So prototypes. Exposed brains of missing travelers.)
  

#### Link to main quest

The players find a Nothic corpse. The reason is because of their Dark Oracles entry in the 2014 Monster Manual:

> Nothics possess a strange magical insight that allows them to extract knowledge from other creatures. This grants them unique understanding of secret and forbidden lore, which they share for a price. A nothic covets magic items, greedily accepting such gifts from creatures that seek out its knowledge.

Find lots of flesh stitched bags. Soul bags. Prototypes. Fragments of a contract. (Infernal contract?)

Arcana check explains soul bags. Leads off to investigate Night Hags. Tormented adventurers and homeless to evil acts.

> No hag present, living or dead. Kas lured the Night Hag to that village in order to allow the Nothic to learn how to make soul bags. Afterwards Kas brought the hag to his domain of dread.

~~The find a portal to the Abyss in the dungeon.~~

---

### Charlatan's Dice:

~~Portal comes out in~~ The Fools Ante, a bar, casino and Inn in Hades. This is where the Charlatans Dice come in. They will have to pass a wisdom save to pass through the gambling area. No magical allurements are used, just marketing and social engineering.

### Psycological techniques casinos use.

1. They make you play with chips instead of real money.
  
2. There isn't a clock in sight.
  
3. Free alcohol.
  
4. Maze-like layout.
  
5. They offer free room and board.
  
6. They restrict your view of the outside world.
  
7. They put on big celebrations for the rare big wins.
  
8. Bathrooms are placed strategically in the deepest parts of the casino.
  
9. They offer loyalty programs. (Points for each dollar spent, win or loose.)
  
10. Enticing sights, sounds, and smells.
  
11. Near misses.
  
12. [Familiar concepts.]([Casino Psychology 101: What Makes Casinos Addictive](https://www.gatewayfoundation.org/blog/casino-psychology/#6))
  
  Slot machines are often based on familiar TV shows, games, places and people to attract gamblers and make them feel comfortable playing. You might find “Wheel of Fortune” or “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” slot machines, which evoke images of winning cash. These familiar concepts keep people playing, even if they’re using a complicated machine. The more they play, the more they lose.
  
13. [Cashless games.]([Casino Psychology 101: What Makes Casinos Addictive](https://www.gatewayfoundation.org/blog/casino-psychology/#7))
  
  When you play a slot machine, you’ll first feed cash into it. Your money is then converted into digital credits. When it’s time to cash out, the machine will not give you your change. Instead, it’ll print a voucher. These convenient vouchers make it easier for guests to forget they’re spending real money.
  
  Table games also use cashless methods to keep players playing by turning their cash into chips. It’s easier to bet a large amount when you’re playing with chips instead of real coins and dollars. It also hurts less to lose chips until you realize later how much you’ve lost.
  
14. [A sense of control.]([Casino Psychology 101: What Makes Casinos Addictive](https://www.gatewayfoundation.org/blog/casino-psychology/#8))
  
  Some games give players a false sense of control. When you play craps, you get to roll the dice. Likewise, when you play video poker, you get to choose which cards to keep.
  
  These more interactive games may cause some people to think they have a better chance of winning because they have more control. As a result, they might play longer, thinking they’ll eventually win back everything they lost. The truth is, no matter how much control you think you have over a game’s results, the house ensures it ultimately wins.

### Cloak of Many Fashions

**Possible BBEG:**

1. Shape Shifted Dragon
  
2. Vampire
  
3. Human turned Ghast because of the cloak.
  

Can a dragon be a vampire? One of the big themes is canibalism or simply consumption of raw flesh from bodies as part of the ritual for using the powers of the cloak. Perhaps a human that, because of the cloak, has become a strange non-typical vampire, or even a Ghast.

Human noble -> Cloak -> Personal Cult -> Banished to the Abyss -> Becomes Ghast with the cult becoming Ghouls.

(If utilized later in the campaign, the BBEG could be a Tainted Priest from the Libris Moritis 5th Edition Homebrew.)

I really like the Ghast idea, so she's a Ghast.

She's a Human Noble, with the Undead type, and the abilities of a Ghast in addition to her other abilities.

---

### Moon-Touched blade

Circle of the Shepard druid comes across a hags swamp. Durring one of their many battles the druid hears a voice calling it. Following the voice they come across an old abandoned church. Within the church is a blade clutched by a rotting corpse. The voice commanded the druid take up the blade, enlist an army, and free its land from the influence of the hag. The two have been at war ever since.

The Druids patron is an eldritch being from an alternate multiverse.

- Alternate is that the patron could be that the Devil/Demon of fungus and mushrooms. Zugg-somthing or other.
